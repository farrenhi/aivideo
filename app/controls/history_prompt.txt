Once upon a time, there was a beautiful snow white princess. She was the fairest of them all, and the King was madly in love with her. He wanted her to be his Queen, but there was one problem. No one could find an adequate answer to his question, 'what do you see when you look in the mirror'. She was frightened by the question, but there was no way to escape it. In a panic, she ran away from the castle and was never seen again. The snow white princess was a mystery, and the King never found the answer to his question.
